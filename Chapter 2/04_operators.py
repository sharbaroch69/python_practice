# Arithmatic Operators
a = 3
b = 9
c = a+b
print(c)

# assignment operators like: =

a = 4-1 #assign 4-1 in a
print(a)

b = 5
b += 8 # increment the value of b by 8 then assign it to b
print(b) 
b -= 4 # decrement the value of b by 8 then assign it to b
print(b)


# comparasioin operators (always true or false)

a = 5>4
print(a)

b = 5>=5 # 5 is greater then or equal to: true
print(b)

c = 5==5
# single equal sign is for assigning variable 
# and double equals to is for comparaing two values
print(c)


# Logical operators
e = True or False # answer True
# example are you human or fish? is this true or false?
# so answer would be True because you are human

print(e)

d = False or False # answer false
print(d)


#Truth table of 'or'
print("True or False is ", True or False)
print("True or True is ", True or True)
print("False or True is", False or True)
print("False or False is ", False or False)

#Truth table of 'and'
print("True and False is", True and False)
print("True and True is", True and True)
print("False and True is", False and True)
print("False and False is", False and False)


# not operator

# it makes true to false and makes false to true like opposite
print(not(True))
print(not(False))
